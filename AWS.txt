Dedicated Hosts:

	dedicated hosts are the physical servers with EC2 instance capacity that are only dedicated for our use

Types of instances:
	general purpose(eg:t3,mac)
	compute optimized(eg:c4,c5)
	memory optimized(eg:r4,r5)
	storage optimized(eg:i3,i4i,h1)
	accerlerated computing(eg:p4,p3,g5)

AMI:
	amazon machine image used to provide information require to lauch the instance.you must create AMI when you create instances
	single AMI is used for multiple instances

EBS:
	elastic block store is a block level storage volumes(like harddrives) for use with EC2 instances.it is scalable as per needs.it is persist
	independently from the running life of the instance and we can create multiple EBS for single instance and both instance and 
	EBS are in the same availabilty zone
